This repository contains the original scripts from the "barcode_seq" project, which preceded the development of "Barcoder." It's maintained in its final state to provide a reference for the methods used before transitioning to the more refined "Barcoder" project. While the data and scripts may appear unorganized, they were functional and instrumental in early research phases. This archive is intended for academic use, specifically to support methodological transparency and reproducibility in related publications.
