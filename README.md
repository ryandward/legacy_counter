# legacy_counter

This repository contains the original scripts from the "barcode_seq" project, which preceded the development of "Barcoder." It's maintained in its final state to provide a reference for the methods used before transitioning to the more refined "Barcoder" project.

This project is no longer maintained. For further development, please see https://github.com/ryandward/barcoder.
